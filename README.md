This is a small Javascript app that takes JSON files of news articles and sorts them according to old and new algorithms, with the capability to tweak the new (proposed) algorithm and compare it with the current results. Stories are assigned scores based on rank, date, and target, and sorted in descending order based on score.


### How do I get set up? ###

* Straight up jQuery/JavaScript. No frameworks no tests no taskrunners. Easy peasy!
