# README #

This is a small Javascript app that takes JSON files of Citi news articles and sorts them according to old and new algorithms.

### What is this app for? ###

The Citi intranet page currently displays news sorted by rank and date. Team members there would like to show the value of a more nuanced algorithm.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Straight up JavaScript. No frameworks no tests no taskrunners. Easy peasy!

### Who do I talk to? ###
